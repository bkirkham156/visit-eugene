Overview

Visit Eugene is a data-driven web application developed in Python using Streamlit and SQLite.
The goal of this project is to provide users with a simple and visually engaging way to explore things to do, places to eat, and local points of interest in Eugene.

This project is part of the CS 407 Seminar at the University of Oregon and is designed to strengthen technical and product development skills relevant to software product management and data analytics.

Features

- Displays local places and activities from a connected SQLite database.

- Clean, user-friendly Streamlit interface.

- Database seeding and management via Python scripts.

- Easily expandable to include AI-powered recommendations or filtering by user interests.

Future Improvements

- Add filtering functionality by category or interest (e.g., dining, entertainment, nature).

- Improve UI design with custom icons, headers, and layout styling.

- Deploy a live version of the app using Streamlit Cloud.

- Integrate an AI recommendation feature to personalize suggestions based on user input.

I am on track to complete my project goals by the end of the term. The main setup and functionality are complete, and the next phase will focus on refining the interface, adding filtering features, and preparing for possible deployment.

The primary challenges involved configuring Streamlit, managing the virtual environment, and connecting GitHub for version control. These issues were resolved through testing and documentation, and no major blockers remain at this stage.
